console.log(`
We've identified and fixed the following issues with user creation through the settings interface:

1. ISSUE: Passwords were not being hashed
   - When users were created through the settings interface, their passwords were stored in plain text
   - During login, the system expected hashed passwords and used bcrypt.compare() to verify them
   - This mismatch caused the "Invalid credentials" error during login

   FIX: Updated the user creation route to hash passwords using bcrypt
   - Added bcrypt as a dependency in the settings/users.js file
   - Implemented password hashing in the /create endpoint
   - Also added password hashing to the user update endpoint when a password is provided

2. ISSUE: Users were not associated with any company
   - Users created through the settings interface were not associated with any company
   - The login process requires users to have a company association
   - This caused issues during login when trying to set the companyId in the JWT token

   FIX: Updated the user creation route to associate users with a company
   - Added a companyId parameter to the /create endpoint
   - If no companyId is provided, the system finds the first available company
   - Created userCompany associations for new users
   - Set the billingCompanyId for new users

3. ISSUE: Invite functionality had similar issues
   - The invite endpoint also didn't associate users with companies

   FIX: Updated the invite endpoint to associate users with companies
   - Added company association to the /invite endpoint
   - Set the billingCompanyId for invited users

TESTING:
--------
We created a test script (test-user-creation-login.js) that:
1. Creates a test user with a hashed password and company association
2. Simulates the login process to verify the password and company association
3. Confirms that all steps of the login process work correctly

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Users created through the settings interface should now be able to log in successfully
2. Existing users created through the settings interface with plain text passwords will need to:
   - Have their passwords reset, or
   - Be updated through the settings interface (which will now hash their passwords)

3. For security, consider implementing additional measures:
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Account lockout after failed login attempts
   - Two-factor authentication
